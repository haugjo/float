# <kbd>module</kbd> `prediction.evaluation.measures.mean_drift_performance_deterioration`
Drift Performance Deterioration Measure. 

This function returns the drift performance deterioration. This measure corresponds to the mean difference of a performance measure before and after a known concept drift. It is hence a measure to quantify the adaptability of a predictor under concept drift.

## <kbd>function</kbd> `mean_drift_performance_deterioration`

```python
mean_drift_performance_deterioration(
    result: dict,
    known_drifts: Union[List[int], List[tuple]],
    batch_size: int,
    reference_measure: Callable = <function zero_one_loss at 0x11d1669d0>,
    reference_measure_kwargs: Optional[dict] = None,
    interval: int = 10
) â†’ float
```

Calculates the mean performance deterioration after kown concept drifts. 



**Args:**
 
 - <b>`result`</b>:  A result dictionary from the PredictionEvaluator object. 
 - <b>`known_drifts`</b>:  The positions in the dataset (indices) corresponding to known concept drifts. 
 - <b>`batch_size`</b>:  The number of observations processed per iteration/time step. 
 - <b>`reference_measure`</b>:  Evaluation measure function. 
 - <b>`reference_measure_kwargs`</b>:  Keyword arguments of the reference measure. This attribute is maintained for consistency reasons, but is  not used by this performance measure. 
 - <b>`interval`</b>:  Scalar specifying the size of the interval (i.e. number of time steps) after known concept drift, in which  we investigate a performance decay of the reference measure. 



**Returns:**
 
 - <b>`float`</b>:  Current mean performance deterioration after (known) concept drifts regarding the reference measure.
